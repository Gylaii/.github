Gulaii helps you break free from that couch-potato life! We turn _"I should
probably go outside"_ into _"I can't wait to explore that cool spot"_ by
creating personalized city routes based on what you've eaten and what you want
to discover.

  <summary><h2><b>Why we're not just another fitness app ‚ú® </h2></b></summary>
  
  Let's be honest - tracking steps is **boring** and diets are **depressing**.

<ins>We're here to make being healthy actually fun!</ins>

### What makes us different

We create routes that:

- Match the calories you want to burn (had a pizza? we've got you covered)
- Work with your schedule (even if it's just 15 minutes between Netflix
  episodes)
- Show you cool places you never knew existed in your own neighborhood

### The real problem we solve

- Getting stuck in the "order food, stay home" cycle
- Walking the same boring routes when you do go out
- The guilt of eating something delicious without moving afterward
- Feeling like a tourist in your own city because you never explore it
